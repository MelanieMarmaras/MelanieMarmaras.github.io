			<h2>ESTEEM GALLERY</h2>
			<h3>logo design and process // november 2014</h3>

		<ul> 
			<div class="details">
		  <li><span>make</span> paper, saddle stitch</li>
		  <li><span>client</span> graphic design II class</li>
		  <li><span>discipline</span> publication</li>
		  <li><span>position</span> designer, production</li>
	        </div>
		</ul>

			<p> As a hypothetical gallery the esteem gallery is for artists who try to make a living with their work. The gallery is located in Back Bay of Boston, MA as to introduce a different social class to their work in order to gain higher selling points. I took the idea of two different social classes interacting and linking with one another as my inspiration for the logo design. </p>
