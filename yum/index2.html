	<h1>Seared Tuna</h1> 
    <h2>with Lemon Dressing</h2>
	  <ul>
		<li>1 squeezed lemon's juice</li>
	    <li>1 pinch salt and black pepper</li>
	    <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
	    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley or dill</li>
	    <li>4 thick tuna teaks</li>
	  </ul>
	  <br>
	  <ol>
		<li>1 For the dressing mix the lemon juice, salt and pepper, and four tablespoons olive oil. Then stir in the chopped parsley, or dill.</li>
		<li>2 Heat the two remaining in a large skillet. Put in the tuna steaks and cook them over high heat for less than one minute on each side, sprinkling them lightly with salt. To test for doneness, cut into one of them with a knife, the time depends on the thickness of the steak. It should be uncooked and red inside, if you prefer less rare, cook for a bit longer. Be careful&#151;you can easily spoil the tuna by overcooking it.</li>
		<li>3 Serve tuna steaks with the dressing poured over it.</li>
