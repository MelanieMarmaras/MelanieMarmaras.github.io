		<li>1 Wash the spinach and remove the stems only if too thick or hard.</li>
		<li>2 Put the leaves in a large pan covered, and set over low heat until the leaves crumble into a soft mass. They will steam in the water that clings to them in one to two minutes. Drain well.</li>
		<li>3 Heat the garlic in one tablespoon of oil in a large pan until the aroma rises.</li>
		<li>4 Add the chopped preserved lemon peel, chopped olives, and cooked spinach. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well and cook over high heat for a minute or two.</li>
		<li>5 Stir in the remaining oil, garnish with the reserved olives and serve cold.</li>
